# Numerical modeling of Polymerization reaction
Numerical solution of differential equations for modeling the simplest catalysis reaction A + B $\to$ A + C
$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

# Description
The reacting system can be described as a finite volume with a random initial distribution $\N$ particles in 
it and given periodic boundary conditions. We assume that the reaction occurs with probability $\p = 0.001$ when 
particles $\A$ and $\B$ are closer than $\4.0 nm$ to each other. The interaction of particles can be described 
using the following potential:
